# Hotel-management-system
The main idea is to develop a software platform that helps hotel staff manage reservations, 
check-ins, billing, room availability, customer services, and other essential functions.
This system aims to reduce manual work, minimize errors, and improve overall operational 
efficiency. 
Scope 
The scope of the project includes: 
• Automating daily hotel operations such as booking, check-ins, billing, and 
housekeeping. 
• Providing a user-friendly interface for both staff and customers. 
• Centralizing all hotel-related data in a single database. 
• Offering reports and analytics to aid in decision-making. 
• Ensuring the system can scale to accommodate future growth.
